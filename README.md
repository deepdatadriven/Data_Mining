# Course Overview:
Welcome. The data mining course presents methods and systems for mining varied data and discovering knowledge from data. After detailing a data mining system architecture and tasks, the course examines and compares specific methods in data mining, such as data preparation, classification, clustering, and text mining. Several applications are detailed, and tools to build new applications are provided. The task of knowledge discovery is then outlined as a higher-level goal of data mining. Familiarity with statistics, and database systems; in particular database design is expected.

### The primary objectives of the course are:
•	Understand algorithms and methods of data mining.  </br>
•	Develop data mining programs and applications. </br>
•	Program using available data mining tools and general-purpose languages. </br>
•	Understand analysis, metrics, visualization and navigation of data mining results. </br>
•	Learn how to use a few commercial data mining tools (amongst a selection of: RStudio, Microsoft Analysis Services, RapidMiner, Jung library, Weka).</br>

### The outcomes of the course are:
Upon successful completion of the course, students are able to:</br>
•     Explain the basic principles of the primary data mining techniques.</br>
•     Explain the difference between data mining, data warehousing, machine learning, etc. </br>
•     Design mining models and manage databases to enable data mining technologies as part of larger systems.</br>
•     Describe issues facing latest trends in data mining.

### Prerequisite: 

You should be proficient in database design and have an understanding of basic database system implementation techniques.  In addition to that, basic understanding in probability and statistics is desirables.

We also recommend that all students have prior experience with at least one programming language such as **C/C++/Java/C#/R/Perl** and have demonstrated ability to work on coding algorithms and data structures. Students with no programming experience or interest should not take this course.
